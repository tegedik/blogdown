      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation: Finding the Top of a Hill</title>

      <description>I think one of the most intuitive ways of describing maximum likelihood estimation (especially to the beginners) can be found in Long and Freese (2014):
 For all but the simplest models, the only way to find the maximum likelihood function is by numerical methods.1 Numerical methods are the mathematical equivalent of how you would find the top of a hill if you were blindfolded and knew only the slope of the hill at the spot where you are standing and how the slope at that spot is changing which you could figure out by poking your foot in each direction.</description>

      <title>Why Not Transform?</title>

      <description>Why do we want to deal with the trouble of estimating generalized linear models (GLM) when it is possible to transform the response variable and estimate models using linear regression? It is worth to mention two answers (Agresti 2015):
It is hard to find a transformation which provides both normality and constant variance (see assumptions of OLS).
 Interpretability. To illustrate, first see the formula of the transformed-data approach
  \[E[g(y_i)]= \beta_0+\beta_1x_1 + \ldots+\beta_kx_k\]</description>

      <description>Here is an example of binomial glm (e.g., logistic regression):
df &amp;lt;- car::Mroz # U.S. Women&amp;#39;s Labor-Force Participation data glmfit &amp;lt;- glm(lfp ~ k5 + age + inc + lwg, df, family=binomial) summary(glmfit) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = lfp ~ k5 + age + inc + lwg, family = binomial, ## data = df) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.7987 -1.1326 0.6516 0.9605 2.</description>

      <title>Lorem Ipsum</title>

      <description>The passage from Lorem Ipsum is here, because it deserves a homage:
 What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since some printed in the 1500s took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only four centuries of letter-by-letter resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged except for an occasional &amp;lsquo;ing&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;y&amp;rsquo; thrown in.</description>

      <description>Random ideas, short notes, quick applications from T.E.G. There will be a lack of organization inevitably.
Although I am a novice, I answered some questions here:</description>
